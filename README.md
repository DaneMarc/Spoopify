## Nitty Gritty
A genre map containing genres and their most dissimilar genres is created by scrapping [Every Noice at Once](https://everynoise.com/) every few months.

The user's top songs and artists are retrieved from Spotify.

Their top genres and consequently the opposite of those genres are computed to show their "least favourite" genres.
